## Welcome!

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my profile. 

My name is Mattia, and I currently work for Queueco Limited, a quantitative and algorithmic trading fund in London. At Queueco I primarily work on providing High Performance Computing environments in the cloud for the quantitative researchers, in addition to maintaining and gradually improving/migrating the pre-existing trading infrastructure to a more Cloud-Native setup.

### About me

I'm a former CDT Student in Pervasive Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh (UoE) School of Informatics and Edinburgh Performance Computing Centre (EPCC). Whilst at the UoE and the EPCC, I mostly researched Stochastic Process Algebras (SPAs), under the supervision of Jane Hilston, the inventor of SPAs and Head of Research at the School of Informatics, and Roberto Rossi, Professor of Uncertainty Modelling at UoE Business School. After my first year, I was awarded an MS in Pervasive Parallelism, and had already started working for a financial exchange in Oslo, Norway. In other words, I left the PhD to get more experience within industry.

Stochastic Process Algebras are mathematical formalisms (sometimes with associated programming languages) which are mostly used to generate semantically correct Markov Chains in a compositional manner. This comes in handy when designing and simulating complex systems. These systems can range from concurrent, or parallel distributed systems, to more adaptive systems such as biological networks for example. You can see some examples of SPAs here:

### Work experience

In addition to my focus on computational science during my time in university, I have built up a plethora of practical experience as a DevOps engineer working across Cloud Providers like AWS, Azure, GCP, IBM Cloud and VMWare ESXi on-premises. Additionally, I have mostly worked in highly security critical environments. Examples are:
- military research institutes, 
- centralized public-key-infrastructures, 
- sovereign wealth funds,
- exchange custodian networks
