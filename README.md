## Welcome!

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my profile. 

It should be noted that most of my GitHub work happens on employer specific accounts, so do not view my activity here as representative of my overall code contribution. In fact, most of my code contribution will be on weekends, as this is when I allocate time for hobby-research.

### About me

I'm a former PhD / CDT Student in Pervasive Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh (UoE) School of Informatics and Edinburgh Performance Computing Centre (EPCC). Whilst at the UoE and the EPCC, I mostly researched Stochastic Process Algebras (SPAs), under the supervision of Jane Hilston (the inventor of SPAs), and Roberto Rossi at UoE Business School, Professor of Uncertainty Modelling. 

SPAs are mathematical formalisms (sometimes with associated programming languages) which are mostly used to generate semantically correct Markov Chains in a compositional manner. This comes in handy when designing and simulating complex systems. These systems can range from concurrent, or parallel distributed systems to more adaptive systems such as biological networks, for example. You can see some examples here:
- https://github.com/Bio-PEPA 
- https://github.com/ageorgou/ProPPA

Since I realised the power of HPC to simulate complex phenomena, I have been fascinated by a broad range of research topics related to complexity science. I like to call myself generalist in terms of scientific interests. 

Briefly stated, I love solving complex problems.
