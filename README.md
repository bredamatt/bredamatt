## Welcome!

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my profile. 

It should be noted that most of my GitHub work happens on employer specific accounts, so do not view my activity here as representative of my overall code contribution.

### About me

I'm a former PhD / CDT Student in Pervasive Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh (UoE) School of Informatics and Edinburgh Performance Computing Centre (EPCC). Whilst at the UoE and the EPCC, I mostly researched Stochastic Process Algebras (SPAs), under the supervision of Jane Hilston (the inventor of SPAs). SPAs are mathematical formalisms which can be used to generate correct Markov Chain models in a compositional manner. This comes in handy when seeking to simulate complex systems. These systems can range from concurrent, or parallel distributed systems, to more adaptive systems, such as biological systems for example. 

Since I realised the power of HPC to simulate complex phenomena, I have been fascinated by a broad range of research topics related to complexity science and cybenertics. This has made me a keen system designer, always trying to think of how systems can be designed to self-adapt, which consequently led me into working as a DevOps engineer within industry. Some of my experience involves:

- IBM
- R3
- Norwegian Sovereign Wealth Fund, and
- Queuco Limited

I believe anything can be achieved as long as one has decided that it will be happen, but obviously within reason. Ergo the suitable stoic quote:

> You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. - Marcus Aurelius
