## Welcome!

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my profile. 

It should be noted that most of my GitHub work happens on employer specific accounts, so do not view my activity here as representative of my overall code contribution.

### Information about me:

Briefly stated:
- :dark_sunglasses: Iâ€™m currently working for Queueco, an algorithmic and quantitative propietary trading fund in London
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning as much as I can about the CNCF ecosystem - best way to learn swimming is to nearly drown, haha
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything CNCF related - things like IaC, CI/CD, DevSecOps, Kubernetes, Containerisation - also ask me about Blockchain technology, I've been engaged in the Blockchain space since about 2016/2017
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Please contact me on LinkedIn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am 206 cm, or 6'9'' tall.
- :musical_keyboard: Hobby: Music production (mostly melodic techno)

### Personality

I believe anything can be achieved as long as one has decided that it will be happen - obviously within readon. Hence, a suitable stoic quote:

> You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength. - Marcus Aurelius
