## Welcome!

Hi there! Thank you for checking out my profile. 

My name is Mattia, and I currently work for Queueco Limited, a quantitative and algorithmic trading fund in London. At Queueco I primarily work on providing High Performance Computing environments in the cloud for the quantitative researchers - HPC-as-a-Service, if you like.

### About me

I'm a former CDT Student in Pervasive Parallelism at the University of Edinburgh (UoE) School of Informatics and Edinburgh Performance Computing Centre (EPCC). Whilst at the UoE and the EPCC, I mostly researched Stochastic Process Algebras (SPAs), under the supervision of Jane Hilston (the inventor of SPAs), and Roberto Rossi at UoE Business School, Professor of Uncertainty Modelling. After my first year, I was awarded an MS in Pervasive Parallelism, and had already started working for a financial exchange in Oslo, Norway.

Stochastic Process Algebras are mathematical formalisms (sometimes with associated programming languages) which are mostly used to generate semantically correct Markov Chains in a compositional manner. This comes in handy when designing and simulating complex systems. These systems can range from concurrent, or parallel distributed systems to more adaptive systems such as biological networks for example. You can see some examples of SPAs here:

### Work experience

In addition to my focus on computational science during my time in university, I have built up a plethora of practical experience as a DevOps engineer. This includes experience in DevSecOps, DevOps, DevNetOps, and so forth. I have mostly worked in highly security critical environments. Examples are:
- military research institutes, 
- centralized public-key-infrastructures, 
- sovereign wealth funds,
- exchange custodian networks
